# How It's Made:

Tech used: React, TailwindCSS

This is a fairly complex site, specially considering it had to be built from scratch to match the specific aesthetic the client was looking for, there are multiple features like a modal pop-up for the portfolio, and Conently's API implementation that allows the client to post new blogs, the site is also responsive for different screen sizes.
# Lessons Learned:

This is the first site i ever did using React.js, which was definitely a struggle to grasp at the beginning, however once i managed to understand it, i managed to speed up and optimize the process a lot more, which was crucial for such a large scale project, this is also my first time designing a site completely from scratch, so i had to review my design and CSS knowledge, and it was an extremely useful experience considering it used to be one of my main weak points as a developer
